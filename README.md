This is heavily skidded and half the features semi work or just dont work,
use pyinstaller for making it into a .exe.
these are the libs you need to make this work:
discord.py==2.3.2
pyautogui
------------------------------------------------------------
literally all you need and if it helps this was made on 
python 3.10.5.
